    <title>Libraries and custom resources auto-load</title>
    <para>
        In order to better allow reuse and distribution of custom resource types, kloudmake support the concept of libraries.
        A library is a zip file, a jar file or a directory that is deployed in one of the libraries directories in kloudmake.
    </para>
    <para>
        By default AeonBuild will look for libraries under the following directories:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>/etc/kloudmake/libs</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>/var/lib/kloudmake/libs</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>~/.kloudmake/libs</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
        It's also possible to specify additional locations by using the command line's <code>-l</code> optional parameter.
    </para>
    <para>
        Any java custom resources or functions located in a library will be automatically identified and loaded.
    </para>
    <para>
        When a non-java resource type is used, AeonBuild will attempt to find and run a script file under the following path:
         [package name with any dot changed into a slash]/[resource type name].stl
    </para>
    <para>
        For example, if you attempted to instantiate a resource of type <code>mycompany.customres.someResource</code> and it couldn't
        find a corresponding java resource, it would attempt to find and run the file
        <code>mycompany/customres/someResource.stl</code>.
    </para>
