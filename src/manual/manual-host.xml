    <title>Host</title>
    <para>
        The Host is one of the principal concepts in AeonBuild, as it provides an abstraction layer that allows to
        perform operations in the host machine AeonBuild is running against.
    </para>
    <para>
        AeonBuild currently provides two different host implementations:
    </para>
    <para>
        <link xlink:href="@jdocurl@/Host/LocalHost.html">LocalHost</link> : This is the default implementation, which
        provides access to the operating system AeonBuild is running under.
    </para>
    <para>
        <link xlink:href="@jdocurl@/Host/SshHost.html">SshHost</link> : This host implementation allows to perform all
        operations on a remote server using SSH. It supports the use of sudo if a non-root user needs to be used.
    </para>
    <para>
        When running AeonBuild, a host is assigned to the <link xlink:href="@jdocurl@/STContext.html">context</link>,
        and will be the default host for all resources.
    </para>
    <para>
        In addition, each resource can have an <link
            xlink:href="@jdocurl@/Resource.html#setHostOverride%28com.aeontronix.aeonbuild.host.Host%29">host override</link>
        which will be valid for that host and any children (unless a children itself has an host override).
    </para>
    <para>
        The host is normally accessed by using the current resource's <link
            xlink:href="@jdocurl@/STContext.html#get%28%29">getHost()</link>, or in the case of annotation-driven custom
        java resources, by using the <link linkend="java-anno-inject-host">@Inject</link> annotation.
        method
    </para>
    <para>
        The host object provides various functions to read/write files, as well as the ability to execute commands.
        Additionally it also provides access to a <link
            xlink:href="@jdocurl@/host/AbstractHost.html#getMetadata%28%29">host metadata</link> which provides various
        host details (operating system, architecture, etc.)
    </para>
